# Citations

Running log of every external resource this project builds on — dataset, pretrained model, software library, or borrowed code fragment — per PRD §9.3 ("cited precisely at the point of use"). Append an entry **in the same commit** as the code that uses the resource, and leave a short comment at the use site pointing back here (e.g. `# see docs/CITATIONS.md#extrasensory-dataset`).

Format per entry: what it is, where it's from, which file(s) use it, and what it's used for.

### ExtraSensory dataset
- **What:** wearable accelerometer + gyroscope recordings from 60 users, self-reported activity labels.
- **Source:** Vaizman, Y., Ellis, K., and Lanckriet, G. "Recognizing Detailed Human Context In-the-Wild from Smartphones and Smartwatches." http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/
- **Used in:** the entire project — all training, validation, and dev/test data (PRD §3.1).

#### ExtraSensory raw file layout
- **What:** the archives and internal per-example file format `scripts/fetch_data.py` and `ats/ingest.py` depend on. Not documented in any README on the site; confirmed 2026-09-10 by inspecting the live site and, for the multi-gigabyte archives, probing the remote zip's central directory over HTTP range reads before committing to a full download.
- **Archives used** (all linked from http://extrasensory.ucsd.edu/, under `data/`): `additional_data_files/ExtraSensory.per_uuid_original_labels.zip` (~1MB, all 60 users' self-reported "original" — pre-cleaning — labels, one `<uuid>.original_labels.csv.gz` per user); `raw_measurements/ExtraSensory.raw_measurements.raw_acc.zip` (6.1GB, phone accelerometer); `raw_measurements/ExtraSensory.raw_measurements.proc_gyro.zip` (8.7GB, phone gyroscope, calibrated/drift-corrected). Every other modality (audio, magnetometer, watch sensors, location, decomposed gravity) is out of scope per PRD §2.2 and is never fetched.
- **original_labels.csv.gz columns:** `timestamp` (unix seconds, the example's primary key) plus one `original_label:<NAME>` column per possible label, value `1`/`0`. The seven mutually-exclusive main-activity columns (`LYING_DOWN`, `SITTING`, `STANDING_IN_PLACE`, `STANDING_AND_MOVING`, `WALKING`, `RUNNING`, `BICYCLING`) map directly onto the frozen canonical class order (docs/TASKS.md §0) — see `ats/ingest.py:LABEL_COLUMNS`.
- **Raw sensor archive layout:** `raw_acc/<UUID>/<example_unix_ts>.m_raw_acc.dat` and `proc_gyro/<UUID>/<example_unix_ts>.m_proc_gyro.dat`, one file per ~20-second recording burst. Each file is whitespace-separated rows `<device_local_clock_seconds> <x> <y> <z>` (`raw_acc` in units of g; `proc_gyro` in rad/s) at an irregular rate nominally ~40Hz. A burst the phone could not record is a dummy file containing just `nan`. `<example_unix_ts>` is the same key as `original_labels.csv.gz`'s `timestamp` column, which is what lines a sensor burst up with its ground-truth label.
- **Used in:** `scripts/fetch_data.py` (download), `ats/ingest.py` (parsing + label mapping, including the g→m/s² unit conversion this discovery made necessary).

### jsonschema (Python library)
- **What:** JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 validator.
- **Source:** https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema
- **Used in:** `ats/contracts.py` — validates every artifact crossing the A↔B boundary (`window_track`, `answer`, `question_set`, `cost_report`) against the schemas in `schemas/`.

### pytest (Python library)
- **What:** test framework.
- **Source:** https://docs.pytest.org/
- **Used in:** `tests/` — all automated tests, starting with `tests/test_contracts.py`.

### numpy (Python library)
- **What:** numerical array library.
- **Source:** https://numpy.org/
- **Used in:** `ats/windowing.py`, `ats/features.py` -- real-FFT (`numpy.fft.rfft`) spectral features (cadence, spectral energy bands). A hand-rolled O(n^2) DFT was the initial implementation; switched to numpy's FFT after benchmarking showed it made building the Phase 2 feature dataset (60 subjects) take ~2 hours instead of ~40 minutes.

### torch / PyTorch (Python library)
- **What:** deep learning framework.
- **Source:** https://pytorch.org/
- **Used in:** `ats/model.py` -- the compact 1D-CNN recognition backbone (docs/TASKS.md task 2A.2), chosen over gradient boosting because it fits PRD §6.3's quantization/pruning/distillation extra-credit path. Training runs on Kaggle (which preinstalls PyTorch); the local dependency is for the model definition, loading trained weights, and inference/profiling.

### matplotlib (Python library)
- **What:** plotting library.
- **Source:** https://matplotlib.org/
- **Used in:** `scripts/make_fig2.py` -- the confusion-matrix heatmap (PRD Fig. 2, docs/TASKS.md 2A.5).

### Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
- **What:** 0.5B-parameter instruction-tuned small language model, Apache-2.0 licence.
- **Source:** Qwen Team, "Qwen2.5 Technical Report", arXiv:2412.15115 (2024). Weights: https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, pinned to revision `7ae557604adf67be50417f59c2c2f167def9a775` (about 1.0 GB, downloaded to the local Hugging Face cache, not committed).
- **Used in:** `ats/slm.py` -- the question parser (docs/TASKS.md 4B.1-4B.2). Its only output is a JSON operator call checked against a closed schema; it never sees the recording and never produces an answer. Chosen as the smallest model on the PRD §8.1 suggested list.

### transformers (Python library)
- **What:** Hugging Face model loading and generation library.
- **Source:** https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
- **Used in:** `ats/slm.py` -- loads the pinned Qwen2.5 weights and runs greedy decoding on CPU.

### Claude Haiku 4.5
- **What:** Anthropic's small large-language model, model `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5`, reached through OpenRouter's chat-completions API with the rubric's JSON schema enforced as structured output. Chosen over Claude Opus 5 to keep the judging run cheap.
- **Source:** Anthropic, https://docs.anthropic.com/; accessed via OpenRouter, https://openrouter.ai/
- **Used in:** `scripts/judge_explanations.py` and `ats/eval/rubric.py`: the LLM judge that scores open-world explanations on PRD §7.3.5's three-criterion, 1-5 rubric (docs/TASKS.md 4B.4). It sees each explanation and the values the system measured, and returns scores only; it is never part of the answering system and never produces an answer. Consistency is reported as agreement between two independent runs. Called with the Python standard library (`urllib`), so no extra dependency.

### Claude Code (development assistant)
- **What:** Anthropic's coding assistant, used during development — not part of the delivered system and not present at run time.
- **Source:** Anthropic, https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code
- **Used in:** implementation, debugging, refactoring, and drafting documentation across the repository, under both members' direction and review. Design decisions, the frozen decisions in docs/TASKS.md §0, and the pre-registered thresholds are the authors'. Every reported number was produced by running the committed code, and each regenerates from a clean checkout via the commands listed in the README — nothing in the report is asserted from a model's output. Listed here for the same reason as everything else in this file: PRD §9.3 asks for external resources to be cited at the point of use, and the presentation carries the same disclaimer.

## Still to review

PRD §8.2 lists four related readings, not yet reviewed against our design:

1. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3699765
2. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3810210
3. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3749496
4. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3699747

TASKS.md task 0.8 asks both members to skim these before the Phase 2 architecture is locked in. Log anything borrowed from them here when that happens.
